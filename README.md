- 👋 Hi, I’m Zoe Layton - @ZoeKLL - based near Cambridge in the UK
- 👀 I’m interested in a career change into tech
- 🌱 I’m currently waiting to start a Fullstack Bootcamp
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple tasks that could help me learn how to use GitHub
- I'm a writer and proofreader, so if you need someone to proofread your documents, or check your English...
Come say hi!
